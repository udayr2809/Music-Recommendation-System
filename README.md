#Music Recommendation System: Utilizing K-means Algorithm for Enhanced Music Discovery

This project involves the utilization of the K-means algorithm, a renowned unsupervised learning method, to categorize songs based on their unique audio attributes. Through this algorithm, songs are grouped into clusters, each representing a distinct set of audio characteristics, thus facilitating an enriched understanding of music diversity.

To deliver unparalleled music recommendations, our system employs a sophisticated two-step approach. Firstly, we analyze the cluster of user's preferred song by comparing their audio features to the centroids of song clusters, effectively discerning the user's musical inclinations within these defined clusters. Subsequently, in the second step, our system crafts personalized recommendations by selecting songs from clusters that closely resonate with the user's preferences, ensuring a tailor-made and immersive music experience.
